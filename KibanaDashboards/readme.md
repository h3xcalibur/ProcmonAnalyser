# Kibanaaaa
For a more convenient experience I would recommend indexing the procmon logs into Elasticsearch, using logstash and kibana.

Included here are **exported searches and dashboard** that holds all of them together, 
so you could reach all the interesting data at once, and once you filter something (process name, path, details, whatever), 
it would immediately afftect all other dashboards. 
that way you won't have to work twice on the same filter idea.

you can import this to your kibana.

## The Dashboard includes all the filters from the powershell script.
